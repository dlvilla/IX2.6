# IX2.6

Institutional Transformation (IX) 2.6 is an excel spreadsheet that uses a microsoft access database to run building energy models from the DOE2.2 building energy simulation tool (www.doe2.com). DOE2.2 is freeware but you have to form a license agreement with J.Hirsch and Associates and install DOE2.2 manually into IX before IX will work.

IX allows the user to build up an entire site of building energy models and keep track of the past, present, and future projected states of the buildings. Past building configurations are important to keep a strong hold of previous energy performance. Present energy performance provides a baseline for future energy savings assessment, and future configurations are used to assess climate, and energy conservation measure effectiveness. This is accomplished through checking in new models. A given building can be represented by many models.

IX was used by Sandia to assess energy conservation measure effectiveness across its entire site. It replaced non-specific energy savings estimates with estimates that were based on 120 buildings with detailed information included such that a comprehensive stragegy for prioritizing energy conservation could be made building by building. The software was written to accomplish this goal as efficiently as possible and is not designed to be user friendly and is not well tested. It is an important demonstration though of a new kind of building energy modeling application where building energy models of existing buildings are used en-masse.

Please refer to the user documentation for more details on how to get IX working. Excel, Access, DOE2.2, and possibly python need to be installed. The software has only been tested on Windows 7 and 10.
